# ProcessScheduler-Java-Implementation

## 1. Project Overview:
- This project implements different process scheduling algorithms in Java.
- These algorithms are critical in operating systems, where they determine the order in which processes are to be executed by the CPU. The different algorithms implemented in this project are:

  1. Priority Scheduling
  2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
  3. Longest Job First (LJF)
  4. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  5. Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
  6. Round Robin (RR)
  7. First Come First Serve (FCFS)

## 2. Key Concepts Used:
#### a. Object-Oriented Programming
#### b. Java Collection Frameworks
#### Data Structures and Algorithms
#### Basic Understanding of Operating Systems
