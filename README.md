# ProcessScheduler-Java-Implementation

## 1. Project Overview:
- This project implements different process scheduling algorithms in Java.
- Different algorithms are:
      1. Priority Scheduling
      2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
      3. Longest Job First (LJF)
      4. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
      5. Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
      6. Round Robin (RR)
      7. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
